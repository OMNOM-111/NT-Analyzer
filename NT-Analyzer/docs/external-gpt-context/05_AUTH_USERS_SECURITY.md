- Scope: Identity, providers, sessions, devices, permissions and critical security gates
- Status: DONE

## Identity model

| Layer | Current fact | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Internal identity | canonical user identity is moving to opaque UUID rather than Telegram numeric id | [../adr/0002-unified-identity.md](../adr/0002-unified-identity.md), `app/auth_identity.py`, `0005_identity_uuid.sql` |
| External identities | Telegram / Google / email are modeled as provider identities, not as the primary key | [../adr/0002-unified-identity.md](../adr/0002-unified-identity.md), `sf_auth_identities` |
| Sessions | authenticated sessions remain explicit and environment-scoped | `app/account_auth.py`, `sf_auth_sessions` |
| Workspaces | identity and workspace/membership are separate entities | [../architecture/MULTI_USER_ACCOUNT_ARCHITECTURE.md](../architecture/MULTI_USER_ACCOUNT_ARCHITECTURE.md) |

## Login providers

| Provider | Status | Current state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Telegram | `DONE` | primary owner/operator entry, bot-based login link, contact verification, Mini App integration |
| Google | `PARTIAL` | provider path exists and verified email can participate in identity/security flows; operational state still depends on environment config |
| Email | `PARTIAL` | provider is part of the canonical identity model; do not assume a fully operational transactional Production sender without separate deployment evidence |

## Account linking rules

- Matching email is **not** enough for automatic merge.
- Linking requires fresh proof of control over both auth methods.
- Owner-assisted recovery is the explicit exception path and should produce audit
  evidence instead of silent merging.

## Roles and permissions

| Surface | Current rule |
| --- | --- |
| Owner | receives the full administrative capability set |
| Developer / admin | receives only explicit structured grants, optionally with expiry |
| Ordinary user | no admin capabilities by default |
| Workspace roles | remain separate from auth status and include `owner`, `admin`, `operator`, `viewer`, `developer` |

Key admin capability names already in the contract: `admin.view`,
`users.manage`, `workspaces.manage`, `connectors.manage`, `operations.view`,
`operations.execute`, `releases.view`, `releases.create`,
`releases.deploy_canary`, `releases.promote_production`,
`releases.rollback_production`, `environment.switch`, `docs.manage_global`,
`docs.manage_workspace`.

## Sessions, trusted devices and step-up

- Device identity is not IP-based.
- Trusted devices use lifecycle `pending -> trusted -> revoked|expired`.
- Security challenges are single-use, environment-bound and hashed at rest.
- Step-up is the intended gate for linking identities, trusting a device,
  personal NinjaTrader pairing, Connector revoke and release approvals.

## Personal NinjaTrader security requirements

1. User identity must already be authenticated.
2. Critical pairing/revoke actions should pass step-up.
3. Connector pairing must bind to workspace plus device-owned key material.
4. Broker credentials stay inside the user's own NinjaTrader login context.
5. Live-trading authority is not implied by having chart data or paper access.

## Current EXTERNAL BLOCKED / incomplete areas

- Treat Production email login as incomplete until a real transactional backend is
  clearly configured and accepted for the target environment.
- Treat trusted-device hard enforcement for every release-critical action as
  incomplete until the step-up workflow is fully rolled out across those paths.
- Treat wide public personal-NT onboarding as incomplete even though the model,
  endpoints and schema are already present.

## Threat-model summary

- No broker credentials are collected or stored by StratForge.
- Absolute trust is not derived from UI visibility, IP address or JSON claims.
- Global governance mutation is separated from workspace/strategy documents.
- Per-environment cookies, CSRF keys, storage namespaces, bots and connector
  sessions are part of the isolation model.
